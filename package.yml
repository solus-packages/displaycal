description: |
    DisplayCAL is a graphical user interface developed by Florian HÃ¶ch for the display calibration and profiling tools of Argyll CMS, an open source color management system developed by Graeme Gill.
    Calibrate and characterize your display devices using one of the many supported hardware sensors, with support for multi-display setups and a variety of available settings like customizable whitepoint, luminance, tone response curve as well as the option to create matrix and look-up-table ICC profiles, with optional gamut mapping, as well as some proprietary 3D LUT formats.
